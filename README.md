Hero Search-Up

# Description

Are you a fan of Marvel Comics or movies? Or are you looking for some information about Marvel characters so you can be included in conversations with your friends and family? Either way we have the application for you! Our team created an application where you can search for a Marvel character by name and a list of the comics in which they appear will be displayed in chronological order. In addition to that, a Youtube video featuring the character will appear.

## Usage

A few members of our team are big Marvel fans and the rest of the members are not super familiar with comic characters. That was our major motivation for this project. During the building process, we learned how to pull information from API's and to dynamically update our html to display the information, images and videos on our webpage.

## User Story

AS a marvel fan I want to be able to search up my favorite characters and view their information.
When I load into the webpage Then there is a search bar to search up marvel characters.
When I search for a character Then I see a card with info of the character and a youtube video relating to the character appears.
